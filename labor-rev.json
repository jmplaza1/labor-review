After summary administrative proceedings, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) set the just compensation of the land at P10,956,963.25 and ordered Land Bank Manager and Agrarian Operations Center Head Alex A. Lorayes (Lorayes) to pay Listana but he refused prompting Listana to file with the PARAD a motion for contempt against Lorayes. PARAD granted the motion for contempt, and later on directed the issuance of an arrest order against Lorayes. Land Bank filed a petition for injunction of the arrest order pending its petition for judicial determination of the amount of just compensation for the property. The RTC of Sorsogon, acting as Special Aggrarian Court, approved it. Listana filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the court. He then filed a special civil action for certiorari with the Court of Appeals. The appellate court nullified the order of the trial court. Hence, this petition. ",

According to the Supreme Court,  the contempt proceedings initiated through an unverified ‘Motion for Contempt’ filed by the Listana with the PARAD were invalid for the following reasons: First, the Rules of Court clearly require the filing of a verified petition with the Regional Trial Court, which was not complied with in this case. The charge was not initiated by the PARAD motu proprio, rather, it was by a motion filed by Listana. Second, neither the PARAD nor the DARAB have jurisdiction to decide the contempt charge filed by the respondent. The issuance of a warrant of arrest was beyond the power of the PARAD and the DARAB. Consequently, all the proceedings that stemmed from respondent’s ‘Motion for Contempt,’ specifically the Orders of the PARAD for the arrest of Alex A. Lorayes, are null and void.",

In this agreement, Wenphil committed to reinstate the respondents in its payroll.

When the NLRC changed the LA's decision (specifically, the order to award separation pay in lieu of reinstatement), Wenphil read this to mean to be the ‘modification’ envisioned in the compromise agreement, Wenphil likewise effectively concluded that separation pay and backwages are the same or are interchangeable reliefs.

The petitioner alleged that a sheriff of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) erroneously levied upon certain properties which it claims ownership. As a consequence, it filed an adverse claim with the NLRC, which was dismissed by the labor arbiter. The dismissal was appealed by the petitioner to the NLRC, but the same was also dismissed for lack of merit. In the meantime, petitioner filed an original mandatory injunction with the NLRC. While the injunction case was pending before the NLRC, petitioner filed a complaint for accion reivindicatoria with the Regional Trial Court of Manila. The trial court dismissed the complaint, hence, petitioner brought the case to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition on the ground of forum shopping and lack of jurisdiction. Upon denial of the motion for reconsideration, the petitioner filed this appeal before the Supreme Court.",

The Court also ruled that a third party may avail himself of alternative remedies cumulatively, and one will not preclude the third party from availing himself of the alternative remedies in the event he failed in the remedy first availed of. The Supreme Court annulled the sale on execution of the subject property and the subsequent sale of the same.",

The third party may avail himself of alternative remedies cumulatively, and one will not preclude the third party from availing himself of the other alternative remedies in the event he failed in the remedy first availed of. Thus, a third party may avail himself of the following alternative remedies: a) File a third party claim with the sheriff of the Labor Arbiter, and b) If the third party claim is denied, the third party may appeal the denial to the NLRC. Even if a third party claim was denied, a third party may still file a proper action with a competent court to recover ownership of the property illegally seized by the sheriff. This finds support in Section 17 (now 16), Rule 39, Revised Rules of Court. In light of the above, the filing of a third party claim with the Labor Arbiter and the NLRC did not preclude the petitioner from filing a subsequent action for recovery of property and damages with the Regional Trial Court.
