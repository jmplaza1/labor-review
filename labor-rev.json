After summary administrative proceedings, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) set the just compensation of the land at P10,956,963.25 and ordered Land Bank Manager and Agrarian Operations Center Head Alex A. Lorayes (Lorayes) to pay Listana but he refused prompting Listana to file with the PARAD a motion for contempt against Lorayes. PARAD granted the motion for contempt, and later on directed the issuance of an arrest order against Lorayes. Land Bank filed a petition for injunction of the arrest order pending its petition for judicial determination of the amount of just compensation for the property. The RTC of Sorsogon, acting as Special Aggrarian Court, approved it. Listana filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the court. He then filed a special civil action for certiorari with the Court of Appeals. The appellate court nullified the order of the trial court. Hence, this petition. ",

According to the Supreme Court,  the contempt proceedings initiated through an unverified ‘Motion for Contempt’ filed by the Listana with the PARAD were invalid for the following reasons: First, the Rules of Court clearly require the filing of a verified petition with the Regional Trial Court, which was not complied with in this case. The charge was not initiated by the PARAD motu proprio, rather, it was by a motion filed by Listana. Second, neither the PARAD nor the DARAB have jurisdiction to decide the contempt charge filed by the respondent. The issuance of a warrant of arrest was beyond the power of the PARAD and the DARAB. Consequently, all the proceedings that stemmed from respondent’s ‘Motion for Contempt,’ specifically the Orders of the PARAD for the arrest of Alex A. Lorayes, are null and void.",
