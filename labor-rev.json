After summary administrative proceedings, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) set the just compensation of the land at P10,956,963.25 and ordered Land Bank Manager and Agrarian Operations Center Head Alex A. Lorayes (Lorayes) to pay Listana but he refused prompting Listana to file with the PARAD a motion for contempt against Lorayes. PARAD granted the motion for contempt, and later on directed the issuance of an arrest order against Lorayes. Land Bank filed a petition for injunction of the arrest order pending its petition for judicial determination of the amount of just compensation for the property. The RTC of Sorsogon, acting as Special Aggrarian Court, approved it. Listana filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the court. He then filed a special civil action for certiorari with the Court of Appeals. The appellate court nullified the order of the trial court. Hence, this petition. ",

According to the Supreme Court,  the contempt proceedings initiated through an unverified ‘Motion for Contempt’ filed by the Listana with the PARAD were invalid for the following reasons: First, the Rules of Court clearly require the filing of a verified petition with the Regional Trial Court, which was not complied with in this case. The charge was not initiated by the PARAD motu proprio, rather, it was by a motion filed by Listana. Second, neither the PARAD nor the DARAB have jurisdiction to decide the contempt charge filed by the respondent. The issuance of a warrant of arrest was beyond the power of the PARAD and the DARAB. Consequently, all the proceedings that stemmed from respondent’s ‘Motion for Contempt,’ specifically the Orders of the PARAD for the arrest of Alex A. Lorayes, are null and void.",

During the pendency of the case with the Court of Appeals, PFIZER claimed that it had already required respondent to report for work. However, according to PFIZER, it was respondent who refused to return to work when she wrote PFIZER, through counsel, that she was opting to receive her separation pay and to avail of PFIZER's early retirement program.

In this agreement, Wenphil committed to reinstate the respondents in its payroll. However, the commitment came with a condition: Wenphil stipulated that its obligation to pay the wages due to the respondents would cease if the decision of the LA would be ‘modified, amended or reversed’ by the NLRC. When the NLRC changed the LA's decision (specifically, the order to award separation pay in lieu of reinstatement), Wenphil read this to mean to be the ‘modification’ envisioned in the compromise agreement, Wenphil likewise effectively concluded that separation pay and backwages are the same or are interchangeable reliefs. This conclusion can be deduced from Wenphil's insistence not to pay the respondent's remaining backwages under its erroneous reasoning that this was the effect of the NLRC's order to Wenphil to pay separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.",

On its face, there is nothing invalid with such stipulation. Indeed, had the NLRC reversed the LA, the obligation to pay backwages would have stopped.

The petitioner alleged that a sheriff of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) erroneously levied upon certain properties which it claims ownership. As a consequence, it filed an adverse claim with the NLRC, which was dismissed by the labor arbiter. The dismissal was appealed by the petitioner to the NLRC, but the same was also dismissed for lack of merit. In the meantime, petitioner filed an original mandatory injunction with the NLRC. While the injunction case was pending before the NLRC, petitioner filed a complaint for accion reivindicatoria with the Regional Trial Court of Manila. The trial court dismissed the complaint, hence, petitioner brought the case to the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition on the ground of forum shopping and lack of jurisdiction. Upon denial of the motion for reconsideration, the petitioner filed this appeal before the Supreme Court.",

At that time, the petitioner was Philcomsat's Senior Vice-President, the petitioner executed a Deed of Release and Quitclaim in Philcomsat's favor. Almost three (3) years thereafter, the petitioner filed a complaint for unpaid retirement benefits, claiming that the actual amount of his retirement pay is (P14,015,055.00) and the P9,439,327.91 he received from Philcomsat as supposed settlement for all his claims is unconscionable, which is more than enough reason to declare his quitclaim as null and void.",

Upon inspection by the DOLE, one of the latter's employees, Santiago A. Espultero (Espultero) told the labor inspector that he was receiving a daily wage of P250.00. Thereafter, Espultero was terminated from his employment by CLS. One month Thereafter, Gloria was dismissed from the service for no reason given. Like Espultero, she was allegedly made to sign a quitclaim in order to claim her separation pay amounting to P15,000.00 despite her three years in service. Gloria then filed a case for illegal dismissal with money claims and damages against CLS. In defense, CLS averred that Gloria voluntarily executed a quitclaim and that she offered no evidence which depicted that force or fraud was employed in the execution thereof.",

Similarly, there was nothing which indicates that said amount constitutes said full and final settlement. The quitclaim was also couched in general terms and the tenor of the same does not show that Gloria understood the importance of the same considering that on the same day that she resigned, she immediately relieved respondents from their liabilities. There was also no indication that Gloria intends to give up her claimed benefits in consideration of a fixed compromise amount. It must be emphasized that Gloria was constrained to receive the amount of P15,000.00 as she was eight months pregnant at that time and lives with no other means aside from her employment with CLS.",

Under the law, in order to allow the employer to validly suspend the bargaining process there must be a valid petition for certification election which raised a legitimate representation issue. Here the mere filing of a petition for certification election does not ipso facto justify the suspension of negotiation by Letran. The ‘Contract Bar Rule’ provides that if a CBA has been duly registered, a petition for certification election can only be entertained within 60 days before the expiry of such agreement. No petition for certification election for any representation issue can be filed after the lapse of the 60 day freedom period. The old CBA is extended until a new one is signed. Here the contract bar rule still applies. The purpose is to ensure stability in the relationship of the workers and the company by preventing frequent modifications of the CBA earlier entered into by them in good faith and for the stipulated original period.
