After summary administrative proceedings, the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB) set the just compensation of the land at P10,956,963.25 and ordered Land Bank Manager and Agrarian Operations Center Head Alex A. Lorayes (Lorayes) to pay Listana but he refused prompting Listana to file with the PARAD a motion for contempt against Lorayes. PARAD granted the motion for contempt, and later on directed the issuance of an arrest order against Lorayes. Land Bank filed a petition for injunction of the arrest order pending its petition for judicial determination of the amount of just compensation for the property. The RTC of Sorsogon, acting as Special Aggrarian Court, approved it. Listana filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by the court. He then filed a special civil action for certiorari with the Court of Appeals. The appellate court nullified the order of the trial court. Hence, this petition. ",

According to the Supreme Court,  the contempt proceedings initiated through an unverified ‘Motion for Contempt’ filed by the Listana with the PARAD were invalid for the following reasons: First, the Rules of Court clearly require the filing of a verified petition with the Regional Trial Court, which was not complied with in this case. The charge was not initiated by the PARAD motu proprio, rather, it was by a motion filed by Listana. Second, neither the PARAD nor the DARAB have jurisdiction to decide the contempt charge filed by the respondent. The issuance of a warrant of arrest was beyond the power of the PARAD and the DARAB. Consequently, all the proceedings that stemmed from respondent’s ‘Motion for Contempt,’ specifically the Orders of the PARAD for the arrest of Alex A. Lorayes, are null and void.",

During the pendency of the case with the Court of Appeals, PFIZER claimed that it had already required respondent to report for work.

In this agreement, Wenphil committed to reinstate the respondents in its payroll. However, the commitment came with a condition: Wenphil stipulated that its obligation to pay the wages due to the respondents would cease if the decision of the LA would be ‘modified, amended or reversed’ by the NLRC. When the NLRC changed the LA's decision (specifically, the order to award separation pay in lieu of reinstatement), Wenphil read this to mean to be the ‘modification’ envisioned in the compromise agreement, Wenphil likewise effectively concluded that separation pay and backwages are the same or are interchangeable reliefs. This conclusion can be deduced from Wenphil's insistence not to pay the respondent's remaining backwages under its erroneous reasoning that this was the effect of the NLRC's order to Wenphil to pay separation pay in lieu of reinstatement.",

De la Cruz and Marin appealed to the DOLE Secretary, complaining that they had not been heard before the report was made. The case was endorsed to the respondent Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations directed to forward to the BLR the records of the case. The BLR Director found that indeed De la Cruz and Marin had not been heard before they were held liable for union funds.

An appeal was made to the Secretary of Labor who referred the same back to the Director of the BLR. On June 21, 1996, the assailed decision was reversed by the BLR and a motion for reconsideration was denied on July 9, 1997.

However, the prohibition on the part of respondent to pursue any of the available legal remedies should the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court reverse the judgment award of the labor tribunals or prosecute any other suit or action in another country puts the seafarer's beneficiaries at a grave disadvantage. Thus, Career Philippines is applicable and the Court of Appeals did not err in treating the conditional settlement as an amicable settlement, effectively rendering the Petition for Certiorari moot and academic.

Under the law, in order to allow the employer to validly suspend the bargaining process there must be a valid petition for certification election which raised a legitimate representation issue.

The ‘Contract Bar Rule’ provides that if a CBA has been duly registered, a petition for certification election can only be entertained within 60 days before the expiry of such agreement. No petition for certification election for any representation issue can be filed after the lapse of the 60 day freedom period. The old CBA is extended until a new one is signed. Here the contract bar rule still applies. The purpose is to ensure stability in the relationship of the workers and the company by preventing frequent modifications of the CBA earlier entered into by them in good faith and for the stipulated original period.
